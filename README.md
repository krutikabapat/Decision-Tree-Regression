# Decision-Tree-Regression
Decision Tree is a powerful method in Machine Learning which is used both for regression and classification models.
A decision tree is a flow-chart-like structure, where each internal (non-leaf) node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of a test, and each leaf (or terminal) node holds a class label.
The outcome of the test is based on the previous conditions.

It splits the dataset in some specific sub-parts based on the inputs given and calculates the mean and assign the each class selected the mean value.

Requirements for implementation of decision Tree Regression in python:-

The following should be installed.
1.Numpy
2.Pandas
3.Matplotlib
4.sklearn
